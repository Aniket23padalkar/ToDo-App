# Todo App

## Behind the Scenes

I didn’t build this in one go — here’s a glimpse of my efforts and iterations  
before arriving at the final clean version of the ToDo App:

# 📝 Description

While building this app, I put in a lot of effort — but I know these efforts will pay off in the future.  
Learning and understanding **localStorage** has given me a strong foundation, and I’m sure this knowledge will help me when I move on to databases.

When I look at the final product, it feels worth it. All the hours and iterations add up, and that’s what makes learning meaningful.
